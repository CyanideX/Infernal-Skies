Watching over you. Anticipating every move. You would never have moved forward without my encouragement... but the success is yours and yours alone. You have done well. I was once like you: Tried and found wanting. That's right... The journal you found was once my own. The bones mine as well. You have done what I could not. You have saved yourself and all of mankind... but, me... you have released me from this mortal coil. I am eternally grateful.",
