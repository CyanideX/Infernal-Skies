	"body": "Your indulgence has banished you to the nether regions, where your hopes for sunlight are futile. Cast down into the dark, your sentence is to roam the volcanic pits of hell amongst its foul denizens and the rotting corpses of your fellow man. This is your punishment for your complete disregard of nature, for ignoring the warnings and signs, for being a destructive force of death amongst the living. You have been assigned a slow death amid these caverns, eventually to rot there, forgotten and unmourned.
	But... you need not accept your fate. Some have chosen to struggle against this injustice, wishing to return to the surface world and to fight against tyranny. Those souls never broke the surface... but, even if they did, the overworld is no longer a place for man. Everything that was is forfeit; all of your worldly possessions are but ash in windy clouds. You must have the clear vision of a renewed mind and strengthened soul to prevail against this curse... Look deep within you. Can you see the spark of hope?",
