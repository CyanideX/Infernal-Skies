Mold these meager crumbs to their best use. Be resourceful. It is not mastery of the land that you should seek, but the ability to feel its needs. This region offers power. Find this... and you will thrive. Ignore this... and you will relive your mistakes.
	If you think you can subsist on the gifts given you here, you are sadly mistaken. There is no boon - no excess - to spend on anything except necessities. Heed well my words...
