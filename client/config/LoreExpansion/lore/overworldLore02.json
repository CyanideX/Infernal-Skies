You, however, must face what has become of this world; witness the destruction caused by your kind and mark the forfeit of the things you loved. Your fate is the same if you choose to neglect the signs. Every material item has been taken from you and all that is left is what you see before you now. This is no fresh start, let me make that clear... nor simple fortuity. You have been chosen. While your partner roams the volcanic pits of hell, eventually to rot there, forgotten and unmourned... you alone can redeem mankind and your fellow from such fate. You must have the clear vision of a renewed mind and strengthened soul to prevail against this curse    Look deep within you. Can you see the seed of hope?",
